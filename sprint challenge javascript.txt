1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
	forEach calls a provided function on each element of the array while map does as well but utilizes return values and returns arrays of the same size

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
	methods are called by object variables and are defined inside  a class while function is defined outside a class.


3. What is closure?
	closure is an inner function that can access the enclosing functions variables.


4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
   1. whenever a function is contained in the global scope it is attached to the window.
   
   2. whenever a function is called by a preceding dot the object before that dot is .this
   
   3. whenever a constructor is used this refers to the object that is created by the constructor
	  
   4. whenever call or apply is used this is explicitly defined


5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
   It tells the child's constructor that we should be pulling in the parent's constructor for use with the object that is being passed in to the child constructor. Like Parent.call(this, ).
